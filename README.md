# discovery-swarm

A network swarm that uses [discovery-channel](https://github.com/maxogden/discovery-channel) to find and connect to peers.

This module implements peer connection state and builds on discovery-channel which implements peer discovery. This uses TCP sockets by default and has experimental support for UTP.

```
npm install discovery-swarm
```

## Usage

``` js
var swarm = require('discovery-swarm')

var sw = swarm()

sw.listen(1000)
sw.join('ubuntu-14.04') // can be any id/name/hash

sw.on('connection', function (connection) {
  console.log('found + connected to peer')
})
```

## API

#### `var sw = swarm(opts)`

Create a new swarm. Options include:

```js
{
  id: crypto.randomBytes(32), // peer-id for user
  stream: stream, // stream to replicate across peers
  connect: fn, // connect local and remote streams yourself
  utp: true, // use utp for discovery
  tcp: true, // use tcp for discovery
  maxConnections: 0, // max number of connections.
  whitelist: [] // array of ip addresses to restrict connections to
}
```

For full list of `opts` take a look at [discovery-channel](https://github.com/maxogden/discovery-channel)

#### `sw.join(key, [opts], [cb])`

Join a channel specified by `key` (usually a name, hash or id, must be a **Buffer** or a **string**). After joining will immediately search for peers advertising this key, and re-announce on a timer.

If you pass `opts.announce` as a falsy value you don't announce your port (e.g. you will be in discover-only mode)

If you specify cb, it will be called *when the first round* of discovery has completed. But only on the first round.

#### `sw.leave(key)`

Leave the channel specified `key`

#### `sw.connecting`

Number of peers we are trying to connect to

#### `sw.queued`

Number of peers discovered but not connected to yet

#### `sw.connected`

Number of peers connected to

#### `sw.on('connection', function(connection, info) { ... })`

Emitted when you connect to another peer. Info is an object that contains info about the connection

``` js
{
  type: 'tcp', // the type, tcp or utp
  initiator: true, // whether we initiated the connection or someone else did
  channel: Buffer('...'), // the channel this connetion was initiated on. only set if initiator === true
  host: '127.0.0.1', // the remote address of the peer.
  port: 8080, // the remote port of the peer.
  id: Buffer('...') // the remote peer's peer-id.
}
```

#### `sw.listen(port)`

Listen on a specific port. Should be called before `.join()`.
